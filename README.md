# dist: distances between strings

## Supported metrics
 - Hamming distance
 - Levenshtein distance (coming soon)

## Hamming distance

The Hamming distance between two strings of the same length is the number of substitutions required to transform on into the other.

Let u and v be strings of length n, then the Hamming distance d(u,v) is equal to card({ i | u<sub>i</sub> â‰  v<sub>i</sub> })
