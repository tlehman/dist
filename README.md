# dist: distances between strings

## Supported metrics
 - Hamming distance
 - Levenshtein distance (coming soon)

## Hamming distance

The Hamming distance between two strings of the same length is the minimum number of substitutions required to transform one into the other.

Let u and v be strings of length n, then the Hamming distance d(u,v) = card({ i | u<sub>i</sub> â‰  v<sub>i</sub> })

## Levenshtein distance

The Levenshtein distance between two strings (not necessarily the same length) is the minimum number of additions, substitutions and deletions required to transform one into another.

The most straightforward way to derive the formula for Levenshtein distance is using recursion.

Let u=u<sub>1</sub>u<sub>2</sub>...u<sub>m</sub>, v=v<sub>1</sub>v<sub>2</sub>...v<sub>n</sub>, we wish to find the formula for the Levenshtein distance d(u,v)

 - If min(m,n) = 0, then max(len(m), len(n)). (This is obvious, since if one string is empty, then the distance is just the number of additions to get from the empty string to the non-empty string)
 - If the last two characters are the same, that is: u<sub>m</sub> = v<sub>n</sub>, then d(u,v)=d(u<sub>1</sub>u<sub>2</sub>...u<sub>m-1</sub>, v<sub>1</sub>v<sub>2</sub>...v<sub>n-1</sub>)
 - Otherwise, there are three options left to check, compute them all and pick the minimum:
   - Delete u<sub>m</sub> and recurse
   - Delete v<sub>n</sub> and recurse or
   - Delete both and recurse
  
Why does this last step work?
